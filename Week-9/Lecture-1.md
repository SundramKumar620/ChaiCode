# Lexical Scoping and Closure Function

Summary :-

1. **Lexical Scoping**: The scope of variables is determined by where a function is defined, not where it's called. Inner functions can access variables from their outer functions.

2. **Closures**: When an inner function retains access to variables from its outer function, even after the outer function finishes executing. Closures allow for private data and persistent state.

3. **Function Execution Context**: When a function is called, a new execution context is created. It includes the functionâ€™s variable environment, the value of `this`, and the call stack. This context is used to execute the function's code.
