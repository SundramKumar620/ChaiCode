# Machine Coding and Resources

Summary:


### 1. **Polyfills**:
- **forEach**: Executes callback for each array element.
- **map**: Creates a new array with results from the callback.
- **reduce**: Reduces the array to a single value using the callback.

---

### 2. **Custom Promise**:
- Mimic `Promise` with `resolve`, `reject`, and `then` methods.
- Handles promise states (`pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`).

---

### 3. **Throttling**:
- Limits function execution to once every `delay` milliseconds.

---

### 4. **Debouncing**:
- Delays function execution until after `delay` milliseconds since last event.
