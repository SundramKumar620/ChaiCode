# Buliding Mega Project 2

- **Install Docker**: Set up Docker to containerize the app for easy deployment and isolation.
- **Database Connection with Docker**: Use Docker to run a database (e.g., MongoDB) and connect it to your app through the Docker network.
- **Factory Pattern**: Implement the factory pattern to create objects or services in a flexible way, allowing dynamic creation based on input. This helps with better code organization and scalability.
