# Building Mega Project

- **Install Dependencies**: Install Express, Mongoose, dotenv, CORS, Express Validator, Prettier to manage the environment, validation, and code formatting.
- **Project Structure**: Organize files into models, routes, controllers, and config for better maintainability.
- **Database Connection**: Use Mongoose to connect to the database and configure the connection using `dotenv` for sensitive data like DB URI.
- **API Error Handling**: Implement middleware to handle errors (e.g., 404, 500 errors) and send consistent error responses.
- **API Response**: Standardize API responses with success and error formats for consistency across the app.
- **Constants File**: Create `constants.js` for reusable values like status codes, messages, and configuration settings.
- **Models & Schemas**: Create Mongoose models and schemas to structure the data and define validation rules.
- **Health Check**: Implement a health check route to monitor the appâ€™s status (e.g., DB connection, server uptime).
