# JS Object and Prototypes
Summary:- 
1. Objects: Represent real-world entities with attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods).
2. Methods vs Functions: Methods are functions inside objects; functions are independent.
3. Classes (ES6): Provide a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods, supporting inheritance.
4. DRY Principle: Avoid code repetition; create reusable, maintainable code.
5. Constructors: Special functions used to create and initialize objects.
6. Prototype Chain: Objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
7. extends: Used for class inheritance to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
8. Arrow Functions: Shorter syntax that inherits `this` from the surrounding scope.
9. Objects Everywhere: Functions, arrays, and even primitive types (like strings) are treated as objects in certain contexts.
