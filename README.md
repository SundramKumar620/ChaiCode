# ChaiCode
Welcome to my ChaiCode Repository!

I created this repository to share my journey of learning in the ChaiCode cohort. I want to be honest: I missed four weeks at the beginning because I wasnâ€™t aware of this. But, during class, Hitesh Sir encouraged us to follow the example of a student named Ixraj, who created a similar GitHub repository to document his learning process. Big thanks to Ixraj for this great idea!

After seeing how useful this can be, I decided to start my own repository to track my development journey. I hope you enjoy reading through it and find it helpful.
