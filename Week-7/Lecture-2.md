# Iteration, functions and Concepts
*   **JS and Call Stack:** The call stack is where the JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls, executing them in a LIFO (Last In, First Out) order.
*   **Hoisting:** JavaScript hoists variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution, but not their initializations.
*   **`setTimeout`:** A Web API that schedules code execution after a specified delay, pushing it to the task queue.
*   **High-level of Call Stack:** JavaScript code execution starts with the global context and goes deeper with function calls, managed by the call stack.
*   **Low-level of JS Engine:** The JavaScript engine interprets and compiles code into machine language, handling memory management and optimization.
*   **Microtask Queue:** A queue for promise callbacks (`.then()`/`.catch()`), which has higher priority than the task queue.
*   **Task Queue:** Holds callback functions for things like `setTimeout`, processed after the call stack and microtask queue are empty.
